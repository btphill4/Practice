## Intial Thoughts **
Idea 1: 1 player
- Turns based fighting game that uses various character classes (listed below).
- Allow the user to choose a class at the start and fight other classes
- Inbetween fights user travels to another area (can be selected?) where they have a chance to find potions and items usable in the fight
- Fighting will allow user to select multiple abilities (Like pokemon), use items, or run- 
- Attacks will depend on range and use generator to decide attack
- Leveling up after each fight (enemies scale? random generator -> player level +- 2)

Idea 2: Same as above but 2 players (maybe more)

Idea 3: Pokemon style (same as above)
- Players can try to recruit members if they are close to killing the player (lower health higher chance)
- Up to 4-6 in a party
-
